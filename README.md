# Above Cville ‚Äî Friendly Skies Watcher

Above Cville keeps an eye on the [airplanes.live](https://airplanes.live/api-guide/) feed around Charlottesville and pings you the moment an interesting aircraft drops in. Think of it as a neighborhood watch for the sky: zero fluff, lots of signal, and tuned for self-hosters who like notifications with personality. ‚úàÔ∏èüõ∞Ô∏è

---

## Highlights

- üîÅ **Real-time sweeps** ‚Äì Polls airplanes.live on a tight schedule (configurable) and filters out repeat sightings with a cooldown timer.
- üö´ **Carrier filter** ‚Äì Skip the commercial heavy hitters by listing their ICAO codes directly in the compose snippet. Want only corporate jets and medevacs? Done.
- üó£Ô∏è **Cheerful alerts** ‚Äì Notifications read like a Bluesky post: speed, altitude, direction, and a quick note about how often the plane pops by.
- üñºÔ∏è **Photo flair** ‚Äì If FlightAware has a shot of the aircraft, the link is attached so your Apprise target (Pushover, Discord, etc.) can grab it.
- ü™∂ **Featherweight** ‚Äì Plain Node.js + [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) JSON storage. No external database, no message queues, no drama.
- üê≥ **Docker native** ‚Äì Ships with a battle-tested compose file so you can drop it onto Synology, Portainer, or whatever box you call ‚Äúthe lab.‚Äù

## What you need

- A place to run containers (Synology Container Manager, Portainer, Unraid, etc.).
- Access to the public airplanes.live API.
- An [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) endpoint (self-hosted or bundled with the compose file).
- A target inside Apprise (Pushover/Discord/email/etc.) so the alerts land somewhere fun.

## Quick start (Portainer, Synology Container Manager, etc.)

1. Open your container UI and choose **Create stack / Project ‚Üí Create** (the option that accepts Docker Compose).
2. Paste the snippet below into the editor.
3. Adjust the environment values inline (lat/lon, Apprise URL, timezone, ignored carriers, etc.).
4. Launch the stack. That‚Äôs it‚Äîno shell access needed.

```yaml
services:
  above-cville:
    image: ghcr.io/hursey013/above-cville:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # --- Location & polling ---
      AIRPLANES_LAT: "38.0375" # Latitude to monitor
      AIRPLANES_LON: "-78.4863" # Longitude to monitor
      AIRPLANES_RADIUS: "5" # Radius in nautical miles
      POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS: "5" # How often to poll airplanes.live
      COOLDOWN_MINUTES: "10" # Minimum minutes between alerts per aircraft
      MAX_ALTITUDE_FT: "25000" # Ignore anything higher (set <=0 to disable)

      # --- Carrier filter (optional; leave blank to watch everything) ---
      IGNORE_CARRIERS: "AAL,ASH,AWI,DAL,EDV,JIA,PDT,UAL,ENY,RPA,SKW"

      # --- Storage path for sightings ---
      DATA_FILE: "data/db.json"

      # --- Apprise connection ---
      APPRISE_API_URL: "http://apprise:8000/notify"
      APPRISE_CONFIG_KEY: "" # Provide if your Apprise API uses keyed endpoints
      APPRISE_URLS: "" # Stateless mode: comma-separated target URLs

      # --- Aircraft detail link ---
      AIRCRAFT_LINK_BASE: "https://globe.airplanes.live/?icao=" # Link prefix appended with the ICAO hex

      # --- Timezone for logs & cron output ---
      TZ: "America/New_York"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    depends_on:
      - apprise

  apprise:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/apprise-api:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      PUID: "1026" # adjust to match your user
      PGID: "100"
      TZ: America/New_York
    volumes:
      - ./apprise-config:/config
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

</details>

When you open the stack‚Äôs log viewer you should see a line like:

```
Watching 38.0375, -78.4863 within 5 NM (cooldown: 10 minutes)
```

Each time a plane clears the filters you‚Äôll get `[notify] <callsign>` followed by the friendly message in your configured Apprise destinations.

## Tips & FAQs

- **Carrier skips are optional.** Leave `IGNORE_CARRIERS` empty to watch everything.
- **Bluesky-ready tone.** Modify `composeNotificationMessage` in `src/messages.js` if you want to tweak phrasing or drop the emoji vibe.
- **FlightAware attachments.** The notification includes the most recent FlightAware photo link when available.
- **Details link.** Each alert ends with a tracker URL (defaults to globe.airplanes.live); change `AIRCRAFT_LINK_BASE` to point at your favourite viewer.
- **Restart-safe storage.** Sightings live in `data/db.json`. Delete the file if you want to reset history.
- **Timezones & cron.** Adjust `TZ` in Docker and your system timezone so log timestamps and Apprise attachments make sense.

## Development notes

- Node 18+ is required for native `fetch`, top-level `await`, and the Node test runner.
- Run `npm test` to exercise helpers (message composer, Apprise client, carrier filters, FlightAware scraper, utility functions).
- Run `npm run lint` for ESLint + Prettier (same setup as balance-bot) before opening a PR.
